## Introduction

The **Sorting Algorithm Visualization** project is a web application designed to provide an interactive and educational experience for understanding various sorting algorithms. This tool visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms process and sort data. Users can input custom arrays, select different sorting algorithms, and observe the step-by-step sorting process through dynamic bar visualizations. The project includes both light and dark modes to enhance user experience based on preference. 

## Features

- **Interactive Sorting Visualizations**: Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Dynamic Array Input**: Users can input a custom array of numbers or adjust the array size dynamically.
- **Theme Toggle**: Option to switch between light and dark modes for better readability and user preference.
- **Performance Measurement**: Displays the time taken by each sorting algorithm, allowing users to compare their efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styles the application, supporting both light and dark modes and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the sorting algorithms, manages theme toggling, and updates the visualization dynamically.


## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started with the Sorting Algorithm Visualization project, follow these steps:

## Recommended ðŸ“‹

For the best experience with this project, consider the following:
- **Modern Web Browser**: Use a recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.
- **Basic Understanding**: Familiarity with sorting algorithms will help you appreciate the visualizations more.
- **Note:** Make sure to Set the array after every result.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MUKHTAR-02/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
   cd Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization

2. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Set Up Array: Enter a comma-separated list of numbers in the input field or adjust the array size using the provided controls.

2. Choose Sorting Algorithm: Click on one of the sorting algorithm buttons to start the visualization process.

3. Toggle Theme: Use the theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes according to your preference.

4. View Results: Observe the sorting process through the visual representation of bars and check the time taken for each sorting algorithm in the results display.
      
## Example

1. Start the application:

2. Toggle the theme as per your requirement
   
3. Set the array input

4. Start sorting and visualising

5. Make sure to Set the array after every result
